 <br>
                                CALS Council Meeting<br>
 <br>
                         Monday, August 9, 1993 - 1:30 p.m.<br>
                               1810 Litton Reaves Hall<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  Dr. Swiger called the meeting to order at 1:30 p.m..<br>
 <br>
  Present:  A. Swiger, M. Fitzwater, G. Jubb, B. Allen, J. White,<br>
            S. K. De Datta, B. Vinson, P. Schultz, S. Wolfe, G. Norton,<br>
            E. Collins, &amp; J. Smith.  J. Myers, J. Riddell, and K. Webb<br>
            participated via conference call.<br>
 <br>
  Absent:  B. Cannell, S. Walton, W. Purcell, M. Frazier, B. Hockman,<br>
           B. Manley, and M. Jones.<br>
 <br>
  Guests:  L. Moore and V. Boggs.<br>
 <br>
    I.        Dr. Swiger welcomed the members to the first meeting of the<br>
              Council and asked everyone to introduce themselves and whom<br>
              they represent. Dr. Skip Jubb will be attending,<br>
              representing the Director of the Experiment Station, and<br>
              will have voting rights.  Swiger said this was the first<br>
              step in the College's new governance system and that the<br>
              Council would have several additional members as soon as<br>
              all of the Chairs of the various commissions had been<br>
              elected.  Swiger said that today's meeting would be more<br>
              of an informative meeting since most of the Commissions<br>
              had not met yet.<br>
 <br>
   II.        Agenda:<br>
 <br>
              a.    Distribution of Minutes -- According to the<br>
                    Constitution, the Secretary will "...distribute<br>
                    copies of the minutes to members of the Council and<br>
                    to all faculty and other personnel in the College<br>
                    designated by the Council."  The Council agreed that<br>
                    the minutes should be entered on the Computer system<br>
                    whereby anyone in the College could access them.<br>
                    Since the student members would not have access to<br>
                    this, Dr. White said he would make copies and<br>
                    distribute to the student members.  Vernon will work<br>
                    with Martha to get these entered on the computer.<br>
 <br>
              b.    Approval of Commission on Administrative &amp;<br>
                    Professional Faculty -- This Commission has been<br>
                    added to the Constitution but has not been approved<br>
                    by the Faculty and Staff Associations and the CALS<br>
                    Council.  Commission members have been appointed to<br>
                    serve on the Commission, however, the Chair will not<br>
                    have voting rights on the Council until it has been<br>
                    approved by the two Associations and the Council.<br>
                    Dr. Swiger instructed Martha Fitzwater to distribute<br>
                    the information on this proposed Commission to the<br>
                    two Associations as soon as possible for their<br>
                    approval so that the first reading can be placed on<br>
                    the Council's October agenda.<br>
 <br>
              c.    Report on Diversity Activities -- Larry Moore<br>
 <br>
                    Last year, Dr. Swiger asked Dr. Moore to assume the<br>
                    lead role of addressing diversity recruitment and<br>
                    retention within the College. A College Committee of<br>
                    faculty and staff has been established to work toward<br>
                    various goals within this area.  The group, over the<br>
                    past year, has addressed the recruitment of high<br>
                    school students and undergraduates into the College,<br>
                    as well as graduate student, post-doc, and faculty<br>
                    recruitment.  Dr. Moore distributed a hand-out<br>
                    summarizing the seven grants that have been secured<br>
                    to recruit minority and women into the College.<br>
                    Also, the Provost's Office has funded two faculty<br>
                    positions, plus one pending, as well as several<br>
                    post-doctoral positions, in the CALS.<br>
 <br>
              d.    Faculty and Staff Raises -- L. A. Swiger<br>
 <br>
                    Faculty Raises:  The College received 3.55% for<br>
                    faculty raises this year, and every penny was put out<br>
                    to the Departments, Experiment Stations, and<br>
                    Extension Districts; these raises will become<br>
                    effective December 1, 1993.  The Department Head was<br>
                    given 3.55% of the salary base of faculty within that<br>
                    Department, and the Department Head then recommended<br>
                    raises for each faculty member based on merit and not<br>
                    across the board.  The recommended raises have been<br>
                    submitted to the Provost for approval by the Board of<br>
                    Visitors at their August meeting.  The Provost<br>
                    requested that the recommended raises not be released<br>
                    until they have been approved by the BOV.  The<br>
                    promotion bonuses and gender and race corrections and<br>
                    compression corrections went into effect on July 1,<br>
                    however only the promotion bonuses were actually<br>
                    received.  The gender and race corrections, as well<br>
                    as the compression corrections, will not be approved<br>
                    by the Board of Visitors until later this month,<br>
                    therefore, they will be retroactive to July 1 after<br>
                    being approved by the BOV.  Dr. Swiger said the<br>
                    University did a study of gender and race bias on<br>
                    salaries, and a deviation from expected salary was<br>
                    calculated on certain faculty and a merit neutral<br>
                    number was generated.  As a result, the Provost made<br>
                    some money available to the College, out of the<br>
                    increased tuition, to correct these deficiencies in<br>
                    salaries.  Also, some Assistant Professors who had<br>
                    been hired several years ago and were at a lower<br>
                    salary than new Assistant Professors being hired<br>
                    today, were being recommended for a special<br>
                    supplement.  Another area that was being addressed<br>
                    by this special supplement was faculty whose salary<br>
                    was well below what it should be or out of line with<br>
                    others in their rank.  For the most part, the<br>
                    supplements are small and would represent no more<br>
                    than a partial adjustment.  Dr. Swiger said that he<br>
                    and Bill Allen and Judith Jones had met with Pat Hyer<br>
                    to discuss the possibility of a similar study for the<br>
                    Extension Agents' salary.  A committee has been set<br>
                    up to look at this.<br>
 <br>
                    Staff Raises:  This is the first time that staff will<br>
                    be given the opportunity to receive a three-step<br>
                    merit raise.  However, only approximately one out of<br>
                    every 12 staff members would receive the three-step<br>
                    raise.  Between now and October 1, every supervisor<br>
                    and reviewer need to attend at training session;<br>
                    following that, another evaluation of the staff has<br>
                    to be completed prior to October 1.  Between October<br>
                    1-16, from those rated superior, a subset of those to<br>
                    actually receive the bonuses will be chosen.  In the<br>
                    CALS, the Department Heads, District Directors, and<br>
                    Dr. Jubb (on behalf of the Outlying Stations) will<br>
                    make recommendations to a committee, consisting of<br>
                    John White, Judith Jones, and Dr. Swiger.<br>
 <br>
              e.    Report on International Activities -- S. K. De Datta<br>
 <br>
                    Discussed various projects, Senegal, Mali, Zambia,<br>
                    SARSA, etc., in which the OIRD is involved.  A number<br>
                    of projects, including the Zambia project, will be<br>
                    concluded at the end of the year; will know next week<br>
                    if Va. Tech will win the Albania project.<br>
 <br>
                    At the first organizational meeting of the Commission<br>
                    on International Program Policies, George Norton was<br>
                    elected Chair and Dr. Saacke was elected Secretary.<br>
                    Norton said that a number of issues and topics had<br>
                    been identified at that meeting which the Commission<br>
                    would be addressing, such as:  What happens to<br>
                    overhead dollars? What happens to salary savings?<br>
                    etc.<br>
 <br>
              f.    Status of Allocation Plan -- L. A. Swiger<br>
 <br>
                    Authorized filling 10 staff positions July 1 which<br>
                    took care of the units which were more than one below<br>
                    their allocation; now have approximately 10 more<br>
                    staff positions to be filled and still have too many<br>
                    faculty, especially in research agency.<br>
 <br>
                    Dr. White said that the restructuring of the<br>
                    College's Academic Office had been completed.<br>
                    Originally, there were four administrative<br>
                    positions - Assistant Director (Vasey), Director of<br>
                    Ag. Tech (Bell), Director of Recruitment and<br>
                    Placement (A. Smith), and Director of Resident<br>
                    Instruction (White).  Two positions are being<br>
                    combined - the Assistant Director and the Director of<br>
                    Ag. Tech.  White said he had met with the Ag. Faculty<br>
                    Association about the restructuring of that office,<br>
                    and they had signed off on the new reorganization<br>
                    concept.  White also said that Mr. Bell is no longer<br>
                    the Director of the Ag. Tech. program, and that Dr.<br>
                    John Crunkilton is now serving as Interim Director.<br>
                    The position description has been sent to the EO/AA<br>
                    Office for approval and then will be advertised<br>
                    internally.  A Search Committee has been set up which<br>
                    consists of Frank Gwazdauskas, Ed Bunce, and James<br>
                    McKenna (elected by Ag. Fac. Assn.) and Wanda Grubb,<br>
                    Robert Wright, and Regina Smick-Attisano (appointed<br>
                    by Dr. White).  Anticipate that the position will be<br>
                    filled by October 1.<br>
 <br>
              g.    Report on Staff Recognition Program -- Joyce Smith<br>
 <br>
                    Last Year, the CALS Staff Association appointed a<br>
                    subcommittee to look at this and come up with<br>
                    procedures to put the program in place.  There will<br>
                    be three awards presented to staff -- a) Dean's Award<br>
                    (presented annually at the staff picnic);<br>
                    b) Exemplary Employee Award (presented monthly); and<br>
                    c) Versatility Award (presented bi-monthly).  The<br>
                    first Dean's Award was presented to Leon Alley, a lab<br>
                    instrument maker in Agricultural Engineering, at the<br>
                    Annual CALS Staff Picnic on July 29.<br>
 <br>
              h.    Budget Initiatives -- L. A. Swiger<br>
 <br>
                    Last winter, Cameron Hackney, Research Administrative<br>
                    Intern, played a major role in organizing these.<br>
                    Faculty in the four colleges (CALS, MVRCVM, HR, F&amp;W)<br>
                    were given an opportunity to provide input.  Five<br>
                    initiatives were then submitted to the Provost.  The<br>
                    Provost said that the request was about 10 times more<br>
                    than what he wanted.  Two of the five initiatives<br>
                    were resubmitted -- Commercial Seafood Program and<br>
                    Information Systems.  A meeting of the Vice<br>
                    Presidents and Deans will be held next Tuesday to<br>
                    approve the University's asking budget.  Following<br>
                    that, hopefully, the Governor will include the<br>
                    initiatives in his recommendations to the General<br>
                    Assembly in December.<br>
 <br>
              i.    Reallocation Process -- L. A. Swiger<br>
 <br>
                    In order to bring about change within the University,<br>
                    Dr. Carlisle asked the Deans to put 1 1/2% of their<br>
                    resources on the table and explain what they would<br>
                    give up.  Then each will propose new programs they<br>
                    would like to initiate if they were to get funds from<br>
                    the pool of money.  This will occur in October.<br>
 <br>
              j.    Phase II -- L. A. Swiger<br>
 <br>
                    Represents an attempt to restructure the University<br>
                    to fit into the resources that we have left.  The<br>
                    theme of Phase II is to work smarter and do more and<br>
                    better things with the same resources.<br>
 <br>
  III.  Other:<br>
 <br>
        a)    Dr. Eldridge Collins requested the names of the Chairs of<br>
              the Commissions after they have been elected.<br>
 <br>
        b)    Dr. Jubb - the VAES Annual Plan-of-Work which was submitted<br>
              in the spring has now been approved; Suella Wolfe has a<br>
              copy of the plan if anyone would like to see it.<br>
 <br>
        c)    Dr. Allen  - discussed last week's tornado which hit<br>
              Petersburg area; estimates $11.7M damage in Petersburg<br>
              District.  Dr. Allen commended the Extension Agents who<br>
              helped in getting the reports filed.<br>
 <br>
  The meeting adjourned at 3:00 p.m.<br>
 <br>
                                            Respectfully submitted,<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
                                            Martha M. Fitzwater<br>
                                            Secretary<br>
 <br>
 <br>
